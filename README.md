## Introduction

For this project, I have a spreadsheet of stock market data for containing information on the daily performance of tickers throughout the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. The data contains information on the daily high, low, open and close and also the volume. This spreadsheet contains 753000 data points. The goal of this analysis will be to understand the yearly change, percentage change and total stock volume for each ticker. Due to the size of the dataset, I will be using VBA code to analyse this data set.
